This program creates an animated set of frames where a wooden M spins whilst wearing a reflective wizard's hat.
To run this program you need to run the animation.ini file. I recommend this command to save time:
    ./povconsole32.exe +A animation.ini
    You can run it with the arguments to modify the height and width of the image, but it runs really slow (mine
    took a little over 10 minutes I think).

I have also included the 20 images my running of the above command, with modified height and width, produced if
you wish to use those as well.
This assignment took me about 4 to 5 hours
9, this assignment was really fun just wish I had access to a faster rendering system.
