1. Reflection
    To implement a pure mirror, within the texture element of the desired object or union you make
    the finish have a reflection of 1.0 and no ambience or diffusion.
        EX: finish { reflection {1.0} ambient 0 diffuse 0 }
    This technique is easier in an offline raytraced environment as it only took apply a very simple finish
    to the object as opposed to the complex approach in an online rasterized environment.

2. Wood texture
    To implement a wood texture, within the texture element of the desired object or union you make the
    pigment a type of wood, give it a color map for the different colors to blend between (and relative values,
    in the example below, you blend between a light brown and medium brown for the first 80% and then blend to dark
    brown for the last 20%), the turbulance blurs the pattern to prevent perfect cirlces, and the scale allows you
    to adjust the size of the circles produced.
        EX: pigment {
                    wood
                    color_map {
                        [0.0 color rgb<0.64, 0.48, 0.34>]
                        [0.8 color rgb<0.49, 0.32, 0.17>]
                        [1.0 color rgb<0.36, 0.18, 0.02>]
                    }
                    turbulence 0.05
                    scale <0.2, 0.3, 1>
            }
    I would say this is easier in an offline raytraced environment as you don't have worry about the math of noise
    function to produce wood.

3. Animation
    To implement animation, you base whatever you are animating off the clock cycle. Say you want to rotate an object
    on its y axis, you could say "rotate 360*clock*y" to have it rotate one full circle from the first frame to the last.
    To produce all those frames and declare the clock, you need to create a .ini file to declare what .pov file you are
    applying this animation to, what the first and last frame numbers are, and whether this should be a continuous animation
    or not (as well as other settings that weren't necessary for my implementation).
        .ini file EX:
            Input_File_Name=a4.pov  //what your animating
            Initial_Frame=1
            Final_Frame=20
            +KC                     //continuous animation on

    This technique is easier in online rasterized rendering as you don't have worry about frame numbers or combining
    those frames into a video yourself.
