INCOMPLETE

1. Carter Fowler

2. A3

3. This program should be a particle simulation, but I unfortunately ran out of time, so it is just a trefoil shaded using a Blinn-Phong shader.

4. No hot keys

5. I programmed this on a Mac, so you may need to edit the CMakes accordingly

6. 2 hours max

7. 10 - I think this would be really fun to implement (might just make this my summer project when I get bored)

Sorry this isn't completed, I unfortunately ran out of time. I wasn't sure if there was any partial credit I could receive for this (I assume not) but I figured should at least submit what I was able to do, even if it is minuscule.
